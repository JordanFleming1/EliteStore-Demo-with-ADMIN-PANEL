Firebase Storage Security Rules for your project:

Go to Firebase Console → Storage → Rules and replace the current rules with:

```
rules_version = '2';

service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow authenticated users to upload product images
    match /products/{fileName} {
      allow read: if true; // Allow public read access to product images
      allow write: if request.auth != null; // Allow authenticated users to upload
    }
    
    // Allow public read access to all files (for product display)
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

Alternative simpler rules (for development/testing):

```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

Steps to apply:
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project: "ecommerce-store---fiverr-gig"
3. Go to Storage → Rules
4. Replace the current rules with one of the above
5. Click "Publish"

This should resolve the CORS issues you're experiencing with image uploads.
